# DATA DASHBOARD

## My second Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using the technologies that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

My site is designed for London Bus Transport.
I have decided to follow the project requirement provided in brief.

## UX

The UX for this project is quite simple, it's mainly a Single Page Application(SPA) site. 
The navigation is easy and smooth for users.
The colour shceme was very simple and makes the site quite visible and readable.

Please note I have insisted for the contrast of blue to be different as I was advised it
will be more beneficial to have a lighter contrast for readability purposes.

## Features 

* All the images for this project have been aquicred via google.

* IntroJS was used to improve UX and navigate site.

* Nav - Bootstrap used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.

* Videos section - All the videos used on this site are Youtube embeds. Youtube used for ease of access to
view the bands videos so the user/fan does not have to be redirected from the bands site to see their youtube videos.

* Gallery -  Icons was used to improve the UX for the gallery when viewed by 
a fan/visitor.

* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper of how the site generally look and feel. 

### Possible feature to implement 


### Getting Started

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Bootstrap** framework,  **JavaScript and JQuery** for interactivity.

### Prerequisites

The site is fully functional without any local files needed to be downloaded all frameworks and scripts
used are loaded via an approved CDN. Before deployment the site was tested on several browsers and devices.
