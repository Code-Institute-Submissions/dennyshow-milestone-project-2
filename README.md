# DATA DASHBOARD

## My second Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using the technologies that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3, JQuery and JavaScript code.

The site designed was a London Bus Transport SPA. 
Data was retrieved via TFL in a CSV file
I have decided to follow the project requirement provided in brief.

## UX

The UX for this project is quite simple, it's mainly a Single Page Application(SPA) site. 
The navigation is easy and smooth for users. It starts when the page loads.
The colour shceme was very simple and makes the site quite clear and readable enough for users.
The Charts was allowed to scroll incase user is viewing from smaller devices.

## Features 

* Images for this project have been acquired via google.

* Navbar - Bootstrap used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.

* Button - Was used to allow user navigate easily on page.

* IntroJS - was used to improve UX and tour users around when page loads or when the button is clicked 

* DC Charts - Was used to render all charts on page to display.

* Favicons -  Icons was used to improve the UX for the logo when viewed by a user/visitor.

* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper with pen of how the site generally should look and feel. 


### Possible feature to implement 

* Animate - Try to add some anime interactions in charts


### Getting Started

The website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Bootstrap** framework,  **JavaScript and JQuery** for interactivity.

### Prerequisites

The site is fully functional without any local files needed to be downloaded all frameworks and scripts
used are loaded via an approved CDN. Before deployment the site was tested on several browsers and devices.

## Deployment 

Created a new repositories on **Github** where the project will be deployed unto at each commit.
At first, use a **git remote** command to link project with new repo.
Then use the **git push -u origin master** command to push codes and every change into new repo

Using the CLI in terminal to call **git init** to start git initialization on the project.
This allows a file/files to be added to the Github repo by calling a **git add** command.
Then any added file/files is being commited with a **git commit -m "commit message"** command.
Afterwards, the file is been pushed with **git push** where Github username + password is required.
Once successful, code will be deployed into your repo and **git status** command should indicate branch tree clean.
