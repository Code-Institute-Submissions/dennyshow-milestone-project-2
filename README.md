# DATA DASHBOARD

## My second Milestone Project

Throughout this project I will be using the technologies that I have learnt so far from Code Institue.
This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

My site is designed for London Bus Transport.
I have decided to follow the project requirement provided in brief.

## UX

The UX for this project is quite simple, it's mainly a Single Page Application(SPA) site. 
The navigation is easy and smooth for users.
The colour shceme was very simple and makes the site quite visible and readable.


## Features 

* Images for this project have been acquired via google.

* Nav - Bootstrap used for quick production of modern CSS and use of their predefinded classes.

* IntroJS was used to improve UX and navigate site.

* DC Charts - Was used to display all data on site

* Favicons -  Icons was used to improve the UX for the logo when viewed by a fan/visitor.

* Wireframing- I just did some mock ups on paper of how the site generally should look and feel. 


### Possible feature to implement 

* Animate - Could be possible to add some anime interactions

* 


### Getting Started
